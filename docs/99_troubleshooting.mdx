# Troubleshooting ðŸ”§

## Sensus started to appear as unavailable in Homeassistant

For Sensuses shipped before 24 May 2023, there is a firmware and hardware bug where a failing temperature sensor
on the soil probe will cause the whole device to lock up. A software workaround has been implemented starting with
firmware version `v0.0.2`.

:::caution 
Unfortunately, due to a hardware bug in the Soil Probe, the steps below cannot fix the probe completely. That means, you will
get the most important information, **soil moisture**, but soil temperature will no longer show up. A placeholder value of -100Â°C (-148Â°F)
will appear instead.
:::

To update Sensus to the latest version, follow these steps:

- Download the [latest sensus-cli release](https://github.com/Ardelean-Calin/sensus-cli/releases/latest)
- Disconnect the probe
- Connect Sensus via USB-C to your PC (make sure your cable supports data, as well as power) and press the reset button
  - **Note:** With the probe disconnected, you should see the LED on Sensus execute a startup sequence
- Update Sensus to the latest firmware by opening a Terminal / Command Prompt where sensus-cli is located and running:
```
sensus-cli update --port <YOUR_COM_PORT>
```
- **Important** wait until the CLI says that it successfully updated to the latest version. **Do not disconnect Sensus mid update!**

Now you can connect the Probe again. Sensus will now appear in Homeassistant.
