# What is Sensus?

Sensus is a ultra-lowpower, Homeassistant-compatible environment and plant sensor. It started as a plant health monitoring sensor but ended up being a more general-purpose environment sensor with optional addons, one of which is the Plant Health Monitoring Addon.

## Main Features

- Measures Temperature🌡️, Relative Humidity 💧, Illuminance ⛅ and Battery Voltage 🔋
    - 🌱 Additional Plant Addon also adds Soil Temperature and Soil Moisture
- **Homeassistant compatible** out of the box, thanks to the [BTHome data format](https://bthome.io/format/) [^1]
- Transmits data via Bluetooth Low Energy and USB 🔌
- Compatible with BLE4.0+ adapters
- 100m of range when transmitting data via Bluetooth 📶 
- Powered either via USB-C or a CR2032 battery 
- Ultra-low power consumption, ~1 year battery life when powered from a [high-quality CR2032 battery](https://www.tme.eu/Document/8eb9b28999c260b79094c97a20531f07/cr2032-p.pdf) [^2] ⌛
- RGB status LED 🚦
- [**sensus-cli**](https://github.com/Ardelean-Calin/sensus-cli) command line interface that can be used to:
    - Log real-time data via USB and save to a CSV file
    - Log real-time data via Bluetooth and save to a CSV file not yet implemented
    - Configure parameters such as time between measurements, Bluetooth name, LED behavior
    - Power-safe firmware updates via USB and BLE [^3]
    - Read device information such as firmware version and MAC address/serial number
- Optional magnetic 3D printed case with plexiglass window available

## Commonly asked questions
### Is the device waterproof?
The soil probe is waterproof, however the main control unit (the rectangular PCB) is not due to the limitations of a
3D printed case.
I recommend to exercise caution with the main unit and avoid anything more than light splashes, even though it might be fine.
:::info
I did test the Sensus in outside conditions for long periods of time and with occasional water spraying on the main unit and it still appears to function, however I can't **recommend**
you do the same. You can, but it's on your own risk.
