# First Setup

When Sensus arrives at your doorstep, you will need to do some additional steps before properly using it.

If you do not have/need the soil sensor addon, feel free to skip directly to [Step 3](#step-3---power-up).

### Step 0 - Isolate the Soil Probe
:::caution Important

If you ordered **before May 24, 2023** please add a smidge of hot glue or silicone over the soil probe's temperature sensor. Otherwise, if your soil contains a large amount of salts, soil temperature measurement might stop working after a few weeks/months.

### Step 1 - Prepare the Soil Probe
Choose one of the available cables, depending on your application, and then **gently** open the FPC connector found at the top of the soil probe. 

Insert the cable with the **blue side up**. Make sure the cable is inserted all the way in.

Close the clamshell connector. You should feel a satisfying click.

</div>


### Step 2 - Connect the Soil Probe
The same steps as in Step 1 need to be done for Sensus, as well. However in order to do that, you need to remove the case first:

    <CenteredFigure caption="Insert the cable (blue side up)" src="/img/case3.jpg" />
    <CenteredFigure caption="Insert the top part of the case" src="/img/case4.jpg" />
</div>

### Step 3 - Power up
You can power sensus either via a CR2032 battery, via USB-C or both. The easiest way to make sure everything works correctly is to plug in a USB-C cable. If everything is OK, the onboard LED should transition through all colors and then turn off.

Alternatively, you can open the back of the case to insert a CR2032 battery, as shown in the images below:

    <CenteredFigure caption="Insert battery with positive side up" src="/img/power4.png" />
</div>

### Step 4 - Insert the soil probe

If you got a soil probe, now is the time to insert it in your plant pot:

:::info
For proper functioning, please do not insert the soil probe deeper than the marking shows.
