# Homeassistant integration

Simply click the button below to open your Homeassistant Integrations tab:

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and show your integrations.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/integrations.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/integrations/)

Due to Sensus using the [BTHome data format](https://bthome.io/), your device should automatically appear and present itself as configurable.
**If it doesn't, make sure you have the Bluetooth integration enabled in Homeassistant.**

After you configure it, the Sensus device page will show something like this:

## Entity explainations

Here's a table of all the entities and their respective meaning:

| Entity              | Description | 
| :---------------- |  :----- |
| Battery    |   A flag indicating if the battery has a low charge or not. Will indicate "Low" when battery is getting dangerously low or when temperature is really low (due to batteries performing poorly in low temperatures)   |
| Humidity          |   This is the relative air humidity, in percent, measured with the on-board SHTC3 sensor   |
| Illuminance    |  This is the illuminance level measured in lux with the on-board OPT3001 sensor   |
| Voltage |  This is the measured battery/supply voltage   |
| Temperature 1 |  This is the on-board temperature, in degrees Celsius, measured by the onboard SHTC3 sensor. <br/> <br/> **Note:** This entity is called "Temperature" when no soil probe is connected.   |
| Moisture |  **Probe only** - The soil moisture, in percent   |
| Temperature 2 |  **Probe only** - The soil temperature, in degrees Celsius   |

## Example Homeassistant Config

This is an example of what you can do with Sensus. This is my own Plant dashboard at home.

To create this configuration, I have used the following Homeassistant integrations:
- [Openplantbook integration](https://github.com/Olen/home-assistant-openplantbook) - for automatically getting the required values for soil moisture, temperature, etc. for each plant
- [Homeassistant Plant](https://github.com/Olen/homeassistant-plant) - an alternative plant component that fetches data from the Openplantbook integration
- [Flower Card](https://github.com/Olen/lovelace-flower-card/tree/new_plant) - a nicer flower card to display information about a plant
